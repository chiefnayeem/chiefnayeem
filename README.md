## 👋 Hi there

# 👨‍💻 Mohammed Nayeem

I'm Mohammed Nayeem — a senior full stack engineer with around a **decade of hands-on experience** designing and building modern web applications. I specialize in scalable, type-safe software powered by **React, Node.js, TypeScript, GraphQL**, and a strong sense of architecture.

Over the years, I’ve contributed to real-world projects ranging from lean startups to complex enterprise systems. I architect solutions that aren’t just technically sound — but clean, predictable, and long-lasting. I write code that’s designed to be understood, extended, and enjoyed by others (and future me).

## 🚀 Tech Focus Areas

> I work across the full stack — but I treat frontend, backend, and infrastructure as first-class citizens, each with their own complexities and elegance.

### ⚛️ Frontend Engineering (React + TypeScript)

* **Architecture**: Feature-based folders, atomic design, composable UI, shared libraries
* **TypeScript-first UIs**: Props inference, discriminated unions, conditional types, type-safe API layers
* **React Mastery**: SSR, SSG, RSC (React Server Components), Suspense, lazy loading, hydration strategies
* **Next.js & Gatsby**: Custom servers, dynamic routing, ISR, metadata APIs
* **Advanced State Handling**:

  * Zustand, Apollo cache, React Query, Redux Toolkit (when needed)
  * Local-first architecture and optimistic UI
* **Forms**:

  * React Hook Form and Formik with deep nested field arrays, reusable schemas, and schema-based validations (Zod, Yup)
* **Virtual Rendering**:

  * `react-window`, `react-virtual`, and custom memoized rendering for massive list performance
* **UI Libraries**: Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, MUI — with deep customization and theme extension
* **Animations**: Framer Motion, scroll triggers, layout transitions, spring physics
* **Accessibility (a11y)**: Keyboard nav, screen reader support, semantic HTML
* **Tooling**:

  * Custom Webpack configs, plugins, CLIs, workspace setups
  * ESLint + Prettier + Husky with workspace-level configs

---

### 🔧 Backend Engineering (Node.js + TypeScript)

* **Architecture**:

  * Layered structure: controllers, services, repositories, validators
  * Clean separation following MVC with inspiration from DDD and Ports & Adapters
* **API Development**:

  * RESTful APIs, GraphQL (Apollo Server + Nexus/TypeGraphQL)
  * Request validation, middleware pipelines, global error handling, token guards
* **ORMs & Query Builders**:

  * **Prisma**: Advanced relational modeling, raw SQL, middleware chains, soft deletes, and performance tweaks
  * **Knex.js**: SQL-first migrations, query performance, raw joins
  * **Objection.js**: Lifecycle hooks, graph inserts, polymorphic data
* **Authentication**:

  * JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth, role-based access, token refresh cycles
* **Jobs & Background Tasks**:

  * BullMQ, cron jobs, job retries, distributed queues
* **WebSockets**:

  * Socket.IO and scalable room/channel structures
* **File Management**:

  * Presigned URLs (S3/Firebase), CDN integrations, versioned uploads

---

### 🛠️ Databases & Data Architecture

* **SQL**:

  * MySQL, PostgreSQL — optimized indexes, JSON fields, transaction scopes
* **NoSQL**:

  * MongoDB (aggregation pipelines, document modeling), Firebase Realtime DB & Firestore (rules, offline support)
* **Data Modeling**:

  * Hybrid schemas with type safety across app + DB + API
  * Prisma + Zod + TypeScript codegen integrations
* **Migrations**:

  * Knex, Prisma, Sequelize — zero downtime rollout and rollback workflows

---

### 🧱 System Design, DevOps & Hosting

* **CI/CD**:

  * GitHub Actions for lint → type-check → test → build → deploy
* **Deployment**:

  * Node/Laravel on **Cloudways**; Docker & PM2 orchestration
  * Nginx reverse proxies, SSL, and custom domain workflows
* **Ubuntu/Linux**:

  * My daily OS and production playground 🐧
  * Bash, SSH, process mgmt (`pm2`, `systemctl`, `journalctl`), log rotation
* **Infrastructure**:

  * Monitoring, logging, reverse proxy, DB backups, cron-based auto deploy

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* 🧼 **Clean Architecture**:
  I believe architecture is not a buzzword — it’s a **culture**. My codebase is isolated, scalable, and **testable-by-default**.

* 🛠️ **Tooling Lover**:
  I build CLIs, code mod scripts, VSCode snippets, generators — anything to boost DX.

* 🧪 **Test-Aware Thinking**:
  From Jest and Vitest to PHPUnit and Cypress — I test what matters and automate the rest.

* ⚙️ **Automation & Dev Happiness**:
  If it’s boring or repeatable — I automate it.

* 🧭 **Product-First Thinking**:
  I don’t chase tickets blindly. I ask: *Why? Who’s using it? How fast? How often?*

🛠️ *"I love building systems that scale — not just in code, but in clarity, maintainability, and developer happiness."*
